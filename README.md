## How to play
Download the folder master/Release/TicTacToeCube 1.5 and simply double-click on TicTacToeCube1.5.exe to launch the game.
Use Left Click to color a cube. Use Right Click to rotate the whole. Rules are the same as in a classique TicTacToe game: you have to align three cubes of your own color to win. Don't forget to think in 3 dimensions! 

## About this game
The idea came out of the blue one day and I made the first version (1.0) in 5 hours, with Unity using C#. Then I did some minor improvements for a better version (1.5) in 2 hours. That's it :)
